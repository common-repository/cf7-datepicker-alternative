A simple Contact Forms 7 DatePicker alternative.

== Description ==

I've used Contact Forms 7 for many projects now and recently started to have issues with their datepicker. Their datepicker displays correctly in Chrome, but none of the other major browsers. So I started to use the jQuery UI datepicker in my CF7 forms and created this plugin to help others.

== Installation ==


The easiest way to install CF7 DatePicker is via your WordPress Dashboard. Go to the 'Plugins' page and search for 'CF7 DatePicker' in the WordPress Plugin Directory. Then click 'Install Now' and the following steps will be done for you automatically. You'll just have to activate CF7 DatePicker.

1. Upload 'cf7-datepicker.zip' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Extract 'cf7-datepicker.zip'
3. Activate the plugin through the 'plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Go to a CF7 form.
5. Generate a text field with the 'cf7-datepicker' as the Class (changed in version 1.1).
example - ''
6. Preview Form
7. Go to WP 'setttings' -&gt; CF7 DatePicker' for animation settings and other display settings.
